PLANNING:
To support the conversion of `.heic` files using the `pillow_heif` library, we need to make the following changes to the `ImageConverter` class in `image_converter.py`:

1. Import the `register_heif_opener` function from the `pillow_heif` library.
2. Register the HEIF opener at the beginning of the script to ensure that the PIL Image class can work with `.heic` files.
3. Modify the `convert_to_jpeg` method to check the file extension of the input image. If the file extension is `.heic`, we will use the `pillow_heif` library to open the image. Otherwise, we will use the existing PIL `Image.open` method.
4. Update the exception handling to catch any additional exceptions that might be raised by the `pillow_heif` library.

OUTPUT:
```python
image_converter.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
import PIL
from PIL import Image
import os
=======
import os
from PIL import Image
from pillow_heif import register_heif_opener
register_heif_opener()
>>>>>>> updated
```

```python
image_converter.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    def convert_to_jpeg(image_path, output_path):
        print(f'Trying to convert {image_path} to JPEG...')
        try:
            with Image.open(image_path) as img:
                rgb_im = img.convert('RGB')
                rgb_im.save(output_path, 'JPEG')
                return True
        except PIL.UnidentifiedImageError:
            print(f'Failed to convert {image_path} to JPEG, skipping.')
            return False
=======
    def convert_to_jpeg(image_path, output_path):
        file_extension = os.path.splitext(image_path)[1].lower()
        print(f'Trying to convert {image_path} to JPEG...')
        try:
            if file_extension == '.heic':
                with Image.open(image_path) as img:
                    rgb_im = img.convert('RGB')
            else:
                with Image.open(image_path) as img:
                    rgb_im = img.convert('RGB')
            rgb_im.save(output_path, 'JPEG')
            return True
        except (PIL.UnidentifiedImageError, pillow_heif.UnidentifiedImageError):
            print(f'Failed to convert {image_path} to JPEG, skipping.')
            return False
>>>>>>> updated
```

Please note that you will need to install the `pillow_heif` library to use this updated code. You can do this by adding `pillow_heif` to your `requirements.txt` file.
