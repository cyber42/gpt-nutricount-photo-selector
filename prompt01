PIL does not support .heic files out of the box.
.heic files MUST be converted with pillow_heic library. An example below:

"
from pillow_heif import register_heif_opener
from PIL import Image

register_heif_opener()

def load_heic_image(heic_file_path):
    # obtain the image data
    image = Image.open(heic_file_path)
    return image
    
# Replace with your HEIC file path
heic_file_path = 'foo.heic'
image = load_heic_image(heic_file_path)
"
